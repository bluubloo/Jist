# Jist
A basic game engine I am experimenting with using the message bus architecture. Don't expect this project to work well or be very efficient,
although I will try. This project is mostly for my own learning and I've placed it in a repository for easy transfer between my different
computers.

##Implemented Commands
* move_player
* open_inventory
* open_character_sheet

Currently all these commands do is print their name to the console. I'm using them to form the skeleton of what I want implemented 
in this engine.
